Vitamin Deficiency Detection System
Core Project Design & Implementation Plan
1. Project Overview

The Vitamin Deficiency Detection System is an academic, image-based analysis platform designed to provide indicative insights into possible vitamin deficiencies based on visible medical conditions observed in patient images. The system is fully local, does not depend on paid APIs or cloud-based inference, and follows a modular, multi-stage architecture.

Instead of directly predicting vitamin deficiencies from images—which is biologically unreliable—the system adopts a three-stage pipeline that separates visual analysis from medical knowledge reasoning. This design ensures explainability, modularity, and academic validity.

2. Problem Statement

Vitamin deficiencies often manifest through visible physical symptoms, particularly on the skin, eyes, and oral regions. However, manual analysis requires medical expertise and laboratory tests. The challenge is to design an educational AI-assisted system that can:

Validate whether an uploaded image is medically relevant

Identify visible medical conditions from the image

Infer possible vitamin deficiencies using established medical associations

Generate structured, patient-specific reports

The system must remain simple, offline, explainable, and suitable for a school-level academic project.

3. System Architecture Overview

The system is implemented using a three-stage pipeline, supported by separate frontend, backend, and AI services.

High-Level Components:

Frontend Interface

Backend Orchestration Service

AI Inference Service

Rule-Based Knowledge Engine

Local Database (SQLite)

Each component is loosely coupled and can be independently tested and deployed.

4. User Roles and Functional Scope
Admin / Lab Assistant

Enters patient demographic details

Uploads medical images

Initiates analysis

Views generated reports

Patient

Logs in using Patient ID

Views historical reports

Accesses results in chronological order

Patients cannot upload images or modify data.

5. Phase 1: Image Acquisition & Patient Data Entry
Purpose

To collect structured patient information and image input required for analysis.

Implementation Details

The admin enters patient ID, name, address, phone number, and date

The current date is auto-filled by the system

Uploaded images are temporarily stored in the backend file system

Each image is linked to a unique analysis session

This phase ensures traceability between patients and generated reports.

6. Stage 1: Medical Image Validation
Objective

To prevent invalid or unrelated images from entering the AI pipeline.

Why This Stage Is Necessary

Without validation, any image (books, vehicles, walls) would still be forced into disease prediction, producing false and misleading results.

Implementation Approach

A lightweight image classification model is used

The model outputs:

Medical image

Non-medical image

Only images classified as medical proceed further

Non-medical images trigger an immediate rejection message on the frontend

Outcome

This stage acts as a gatekeeper, significantly reducing false positives.

7. Stage 2: Disease Detection Using AI Model
Objective

To identify visible medical conditions from validated medical images.

Model Used

A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Fine-tuned on skin-related medical conditions

Stored locally as a trained model file

Implementation Logic

The AI service receives the validated image

The model performs inference and outputs:

Disease name

Confidence score

A confidence threshold is applied

Low-confidence predictions are discarded

High-confidence predictions proceed to the next stage

Important Note

The model detects diseases or conditions, not vitamin deficiencies directly.

8. Stage 3: Rule-Based Vitamin Inference Engine
Objective

To infer possible vitamin deficiencies based on detected diseases.

Rationale

Vitamin deficiencies are medically associated with certain diseases, but they cannot be visually confirmed with certainty. Therefore, rule-based inference is used instead of AI.

Implementation Approach

A CSV file stores disease-to-vitamin mappings

Each disease may map to:

One or more vitamins

Different association strengths

The backend searches the CSV using the detected disease

Matching vitamin categories are retrieved and ranked

Output

A list of possible vitamin deficiencies, not definitive diagnoses.

9. Nutrition & Recommendation Engine
Objective

To provide educational dietary guidance for inferred vitamin deficiencies.

Implementation Details

Each vitamin has predefined food sources and dietary advice

Recommendations are stored as structured rule-based data

No generative AI is used

The system outputs:

Vitamin name

Common food sources

Nutritional notes

This ensures accuracy, consistency, and safety.

10. Report Generation & Storage
Objective

To create structured, patient-specific analysis records.

Report Contents

Patient details

Uploaded image reference

Detected disease

Confidence score

Inferred vitamin deficiencies

Nutrition suggestions

Timestamp

Storage Approach

Reports are stored in an SQLite database

Indexed by patient ID and date

Multiple reports per patient are supported

11. Patient Dashboard & Report Retrieval
Objective

To allow patients to view historical analysis results.

Implementation

Patient logs in using ID

Backend fetches reports linked to that ID

Reports are displayed in descending order by date

Each report can be expanded for full details

Patients cannot edit or delete reports.

12. Deployment & Containerization Strategy
Implementation

Frontend, Backend, and AI Service run in separate Docker containers

Docker Compose manages networking and startup order

Model files and database are mounted as persistent volumes

Benefits

Modular

Portable

Easy to test

No dependency conflicts

13. Validation, Error Handling & Testing
Validation

Stage-wise testing is performed

Each stage can fail safely without breaking the system

Error Handling

Invalid images rejected early

Low-confidence predictions blocked

Missing rule mappings handled gracefully

14. Ethical Disclaimer & Academic Compliance

This system is not a medical diagnostic tool.
All outputs are educational and indicative only.

The project demonstrates how AI and rule-based systems can be combined responsibly in healthcare education.

15. Conclusion


The proposed Vitamin Deficiency Detection System presents a structured, modular, and academically sound approach to applying AI in medical image analysis. By separating visual disease detection from vitamin inference, the system avoids biological overclaims while maintaining technical depth and explainability.
